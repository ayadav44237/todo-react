# Todo App

### Project Overview
The Todo App is a web application developed using React, designed to efficiently manage tasks by allowing users to create, update, and delete todos. The user interface is polished and intuitive, ensuring a seamless experience for task management.

### Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- React
- JavaScript

### Data persistence using LocalStorage
- Persistence means the capability of data to remain stored and available even after the application or system that created it has been closed or restarted.
- This project utilizes `localStorage` as a database solution which ensures that the tasks added by the user are preserved even if the page is refreshed.
  
### Features
- **Effortless Task Management**: Users can easily add, edit, and remove tasks using the intuitive interface.
- **Intelligent Sorting**: The app automatically arranges tasks in a logical order. The most recently added tasks are displayed at the top, ensuring users always have quick access to their latest tasks.
- **Organized Completion**: Completed tasks are thoughtfully placed at the bottom of the list, providing a clean separation between pending and finished tasks.
